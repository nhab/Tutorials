    Module      : is a js object which contain services, directives, controllers, filters, and configs.
                    (like: var app = angular.module("myApp", []);) 
        -angular.module is used to configure the $injector.
        -it is defined by a angular.module javascript function which have 2 parameter
            1.module name: a namespace like string  
            2.collection of services,directives,controllers,configs,filters,...
        -angular.module is used to configure the $injector.
                // Create a new module
                var myModule = angular.module('myModule', []);

                // register a new service
                myModule.value('appName', 'MyCoolApp');

                // configure existing services inside initialization blocks.
                myModule.config(['$locationProvider', function($locationProvider) {
                // Configure existing providers
                $locationProvider.hashPrefix('!');
                }]);

                Then you can create an injector and load your modules like this:

                var injector = angular.injector(['ng', 'myModule'])
    
        -Module vs namespace: despite namespaces, modules also have methods on them	for initializations and
            for creation of controllers, services, etc.  
        X:
            <div ng-app="myApp">...</div>
            <script>
                //module definition:
                var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
                //the second parameter  is a list of strings that refer to other module names
                //and allows your new module to inherit the controllers, services, etc. from those modules. 
            </script>
            
        -a simple module consists of a collection of two kinds of blocks:
        {:
            Configuration blocks 
                - get executed during the provider registrations and configuration phase. 
                Only providers and constants can be injected into configuration blocks.
                    This is to prevent accidental instantiation of services before they have been fully configured.
            Run blocks 
                - get executed after the injector is created and are used to kickstart the application.
                - Only instances and constants can be injected into run blocks.
                This is to prevent further system configuration during application run time.
                
                -Run blocks are the closest thing in Angular to the main method. 
                A run block is the code which needs to run to kickstart the application. 
                It is executed after all of the services have been configured and the injector has been created. 
                Run blocks typically contain code which is hard to unit-test, and for this reason should be declared 
                in isolated modules, so that they can be ignored in the unit-tests.
        X:
            angular.module('myModule', []).
            config(function(injectables) { // provider-injector
                // This is an example of config block.
                // You can have as many of these as you want.
                // You can only inject Providers (not instances)
                // into config blocks.
            }).
            run(function(injectables) { // instance-injector
                // This is an example of a run block.
                // You can have as many of these as you want.
                // You can only inject instances (not Providers)
                // into run blocks
            });
        

    controller	: a place for setting model properties and function.
            - is a regulare JavaScript object which :
                - is attached to the DOM via the 'ng-controller' directive. 
                created by a standard JS object 'constructor',
                accepts '$scope' as a parameter,
                containing attributes/properties and functions.

                        };
                    }]);
                    
                or by gttting data from backend :
                    app.controller('BookController', ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http) {  
                        var bookId = 1;
                        $http.get('ourserver/books/' + bookId).success(
                            function(bookData) {
                                $scope.book = bookData;
                            });
                    }]);
                    
                usage in html template :
                    <div ng-controller="BookController">  
                        Id: <span ng-bind="book.id"></span>
                        <br/>
                        Name:<input type="text" ng-model="book.name" />
                        <br/>
                        Author: <input type="text" ng-model="book.author" />
                    </div>

        -Definig a Controller :
            ng-controller=:"Ctl"
        Role:
            The role of controllers in Angular is to expose data to our view via $scope, 
            and to add functions to $scope that contain business logic to enhance view behavior. 

    scope 		: context where the MODEL is stored so that controllers, directives and expressions can access it
        -every controller has an associated $scope object.
        -only methods defined on this $scope object are accessible from HTML/view.
        -scopes are hierarcical and follow DOM hierarcy.

        -AngularJS has 2 scope objects :
            1- $rootScope 
                -root scope (parent of alll scopes)
                -an app can have only one $rootScope
                -it acts like a global variable.

            2- $scope
                -The scope "data life cycle" phases
                    1-creation
                        The root scope is created during the "application bootstrap" by the $injector.
                        During template linking,some directives create new child scopes.

                    2-"watcher registration"
                        during template linking directives register watcher on the scope.
                        -these watches will be used to propaginate model values to DOM.

                    3-Model mutation
                    4-mutation observation
                    5-scope destruction
    service	and built-in services	: is a global object that is available for  your  application.(:X $Injector ,$http )
        AngularJS has about 30 built-in services.

                    In Built ngRoute is simply routing a single URL which you can bind to the single controller
                    with the single template.
                    ngRoute is a separate module which contains following:

                                    It will work with the address bar contents ($location.path) values to match.
                                    To match the parameters, you can use the colon in the path name.

                    :UI-Router in angular js is basically based on the state machine which provides the routing mechanism and nested functions.
                    :process
                        installation
                            For Installation of UI Router library, you can either use Bower or you can choose to download the release version.
                                $ bower install angular-ui-router --save
                            Also you need the source file that contains the page:
                                <script type = "text/javascript" 
                                src = "app/bower_components/angular-ui-router/release/angular-ui-router.js">
                                </ script>
                        using
                            1.It is necessary to inject the UI Router in your app to use it.
                                Basic SYNTAX:
                                    module(‘myapp’,[‘ui.router’]).controller
                                HTML Syntax for UI Router

                                        <div ui-view></div>
                                    </div>
                            2.Your content will be injected in between ui-view div.
                                Content Syntax for UI Router:
                                After body tag, add the above tag.
                            Basic UI Router Syntax:
                                It is used in order to define any state in UI Router
                                .module(‘myapp’,[‘ui.router’]).config(function($stateProvider, $urlRouterProvider)
                                {
                                    $urlRouterProvider.otherwise(‘admin’).
                                    $stateProvider.state(‘Name you pass in ui-sref’, {
                                            url: ‘path to url’,
                                            templateUrl: “filename”
                                    });
                                }
                                

                                $urlRouterProvider otherwise method is used to check if state not found, redirect user to the page passed in the otherwise() method.														<a ui-sref="admin">Admin</a> 
    state
        : is just a state machine which acts like state machine in the top of the ngRoute.
        Internally, It will manage state and based on state it will provide.

        $StateProvider (service provider)
            is used to configure the routing in Angular JS.

        State V/S Route
            diffrences 
                    State						Route
                ---------------------------------------------------------
                A Place within App 			A URL within App
                Nested Hierarchy 			Flat Hierarchy
                Names are just names 		Names are URLs
                Multiple Views(ui-view) 	Single view (ng-view)
                Populate any view 			Populate specific view
                State populates ‘parts’ 	Directive populates ‘parts’
                
            Similarities
            -----------------------------------------------------------
                1. Associate a URL(optional in ui router)
                2. You can apply a template/templateUrl
                3. Can assign controller
                4. Can resolve dependencies before controller initiates
                5. Redirects using when()

        Nesting (Nested Views)
            :X
                <div ng-controller="parentcontroller">
                    <p>{{name}}</p>
                    <p ng-controller="childcontroller">{{address}}</p>
                </div>
            How to 
                How child state made
                    $StateProvider.state ('contacts.list', {});
                How to activate State?
                    1.	$state.go()
                    2.ui-sref Navigate to the state URLs
                        $state.go('destination.state');
                        <a ui-sref="">
        Abstract States
            Abstract means a state. It is not get activated by itself.
            It will be activated when any child of state will be activated.
                
    Providers   : are the only service you can pass into your .config() function.
        - Use a provider when you want to provide module-wide configuration for your service object before making it available.
    templates   : are written with HTML that contains Angular-specific elements and attribute
        :X
            <html ng-app>
            <!-- Body tag augmented with ngController directive  -->
            <body ng-controller="MyController">
            <input ng-model="foo" value="bar">
            <!-- Button tag with ng-click directive, and
                    string expression 'buttonText'
                    wrapped in "{{ }}" markup -->
            <button ng-click="changeFoo()">{{buttonText}}</button>
            <script src="angular.js">
            </body>
            </html> 
    #Dependency Injection(DI) :
        :
        -When applying DI, the objects are given their dependencies at creation time,by some external entity . 
        In other words, dependencies are injected into objects

        The Angular injector subsystem is in charge of creating components, 
        resolving their dependencies, and providing them to other components as requested.

        -DI is pushing out dependencies to the calling objects.
        -Dependency Injection was originally called Inversion of Control (IoC) because
        the normal control sequence would be the object finds the objects it depends on by itself
        and then calls them. 
        Here, this is reversed: The dependencies are handed to the object when it's created. 
        This also illustrates the Hollywood Principle at work: Don't call around for your dependencies,
        we'll give them to you when we need you.
        :{
            Dependency injection involves four roles:
                the service object(s) to be used
                the client object that is depending on the services it uses
                the interfaces that define how the client may use the services
                the injector, which is responsible for constructing the services and injecting them into the client

:process (and Mechnisms)
    creating angular application,regular aproach:
        javascript part:
            1-defining module 
                x:	var mainApp = angular.module("mainApp", []);
            2-defining controlers and defining models fields in its function  
                x: mainApp.controller("shapeController", function($scope) {
                    $scope.message = "In shape controller";
                    $scope.type = "Shape";
                });
                
        Html Part:
            1-defining 'module' :
                we start by adding ng-app="myApp" to a <div> or <html> on which myApp is name of a module.
                //we can also add ng-app with no parameter like <html ng-app>
            2- using 'controlers' within module
                <div ng-controller = "circleController">
            3-using 'expressions' to show data within controller
                <p>{{message}} <br/> 
    Referencing:
        <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/angularjs/1.0.8/angular.min.js"></script>
    Custom directives
        angular.module('yourApp',  [])  
        .directive('myDirective',  function()  {  
            return  {  
            restrict: 'E',  
            template:  '<a href="http://www.techstrikers.com">click here</a>'  
            }  
        }); 
    Change tracking
        Your application does not have to expose any events or trigger any callbacks.
        Instead, you can simply add methods to your model classes which 
        perform the necessary data combination and/or retrieval:

        function UserController($scope) {
            $scope.currentUser = {
                firstName: "John",
                lastName: "Doe"
            };

            $scope.getFullName = function() {
                return $scope.currentUser.firstName + " " + $scope.currentUser.lastName;
            };
        }
        You can then change the HTML markup to directly bind to the result of this method:
        
        <div ng-app ng-controller="UserController">
            First Name: <input type=text ng-model="currentUser.firstName"> <br>
            Last Name: <input type=text ng-model="currentUser.lastName"><br>
            Full Name: {{getFullName()}}
        </div>
    defining routes
        x:
            // script.js
            // create the module and name it scotchApp
            // also include ngRoute for all our routing needs
            
            var scotchApp = angular.module('scotchApp', ['ngRoute']);

            // configure our routes
            scotchApp.config(function($routeProvider) {
                $routeProvider

                    // route for the home page
                    .when('/', {
                        templateUrl : 'pages/home.html',
                        controller  : 'mainController'
                    })

                    // route for the about page
                    .when('/about', {
                        templateUrl : 'pages/about.html',
                        controller  : 'aboutController'
                    })

                    // route for the contact page
                    .when('/contact', {
                        templateUrl : 'pages/contact.html',
                        controller  : 'contactController'
                    });
            });

            // create the controller and inject Angular's $scope
            scotchApp.controller('mainController', function($scope) {
                // create a message to display in our view
                $scope.message = 'Everyone come and see how good I look!';
            });

            scotchApp.controller('aboutController', function($scope) {
                $scope.message = 'Look! I am an about page.';
            });

            scotchApp.controller('contactController', function($scope) {
                $scope.message = 'Contact us! JK. This is just a demo.';
            });
    debuging
        1.Checking these check list?
            -view source code of html
            -is there any ng-app and ng-controller inside the body 
            or (its elements) of html?

            -is the name of ng-controller in html element ,
            the same as one in javascript ?

            -are  'ng-click=' are bound to the right $cope function in Controller?  
        2.Debugging from the DOM
            -by coding in chrome>console
            we can get access to the Angular properties that are attached to any DOM element.
                we can use the jQuery selector syntax in debugger of browser : $("selector")
                or document.querySelector() method in javascript
                in chrome console we can run this code and in sources,watch the values
                    var rootEle = document.querySelector("html");
                    var ele = angular.element(rootEle);
                    var scope = ele.scope(); //scope
                    var ctrl = ele.controller();//controller
                    var d=ele.inheritedData();
        3.by debugger in chrome > debugger and stop watch on functions body
        4.Angular Batarang
            is a Chrome extension developed by the Angular team at Google that
            integrates as a debugging tool for Angular apps.
