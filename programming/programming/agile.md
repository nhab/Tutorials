#Agile manifesto
        (Individuals and intractions)	 over (Processes and tools)
        (working product) 				 over (comprehensive documentation)
        (customer collaboration) 		 over (contract negotiation)
        (Responding to change) 			 over (following a plan)
#Principals
    1-Early delivery:
        early and continuous delivery of valuable and working software 
        ,from a	couple of weeks to a couple of months
        , with a preference to the shorter timescale.

    2-Welcome changes
        Welcome changing requirements, even late in development.
        Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage. 

    3-cooperation
        Business people and developers must work
        together daily throughout the project.

    4-motivation
        Build projects around motivated individuals.
        Give them the environment and support they need,
        and trust them to get the job done.

    5-conveying information 
        The most efficient and effective method of
        conveying information to and within a development
        team is face-to-face conversation.

    6-measure of progress
        Working software is the primary measure of progress.

    7-Agile processes promote sustainable development.
    The sponsors, developers, and users should be able
    to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

    8-Continuous attention to technical excellence
    and good design enhances agility.

    9-Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount
    of work not done--is essential.

    10-The best architectures, requirements, and designs
    emerge from self-organizing teams.

    11-At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
    to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
    its behavior accordingly. 
:roles
    Agile Coach Role & Responsibility
        -Facilitator:
            Facilitate the team with the knowledge so that team can start the project.
        -Trainer:
            Provide training to the team on the agile process; training will continue all the time during the project execution and continuous improvement on velocity, quality, processes etc.
        -Make the winning strategy according as per the ground conditions
        -Help in preparing the overall planning of the project that means he will work as a consultant. He will provide various ideas, suggestions, strategies.
        Make sure that team is following agile processes in each sprint at user story level as per the Definition of Done (DoD); However this is the responsibility of the Process Check Master but if project does not have a role of process check master, this activity should be handled by the agile coach.

        -Help team to answer all the questions on the agile process during the project execution; that means agile coach need to be on the ground so that he can answer the questions immediately.
        -Identify project risks and raise them proactively
        -Mentor:
            Focusing on people and Continuous Improvement all the time; provide team a platform for improvement not only during the retro but all the time. Create a safe environment for healthy conflict and meaningful collaboration.
        -Identify process issues and improve them
        -Help product owner to write user stories
        -Help team on the estimating of the user stories and prepare them for the same
        -Provide capacity calculator template for the team
        -Provide the common tasking codes for the team for better tracking on technical front
        -Help scrum master to plan meetings like
            preplanning,
            planning,
            daily scrum,
            Review & Retrospective

:how to
    Agile teams
        are formed (mostly) of generalizing specialists. A generalizing specialist, sometimes called a craftsperson, is someone who has one or more technical specialties (e.g. Java programming, project management, database administration, ...) so that they can contribute something of direct value to the team, has at least a general knowledge of software development and the business domain in which they work, and most importantly actively seeks to gain new skills in both their existing specialties as well as in other areas, including both technical and domain areas. Obviously novice IT professionals, and traditional IT professionals who are often specialized in just one area, will need to work towards this goal. Generalizing specialists are the sweet spot between the two extremes of specialists, people who know a lot about a narrow domain, and generalists who know a little about a wide range of topics.

    A persona
        :
            first introduced by Alan Cooper, defines an archetypical user of a system,
            an example of the kind of person who would interact with it.
            The idea is that if you want to design effective software, 
            then it needs to be designed for a specific person. 
            
            For the bank, potential personas could be named Frances Miller and Ross Williams.
            In other words, personas represent fictitious people which are based on your knowledge of real users.

            You're likely familiar with actors. 
            Unlike actors, personas are not roles which people play.
            In use case modeling actors represent the roles that users, and even other systems, can take with respect to your system. 
            For example, in a banking application we would have actors such as Customer and Credit Card Processor. 
            Actors are often documented by a sentence or two describing the role.
            For example the description for Customer might read "A person or organization which does business with the bank."

            Personas are different because they describe an archetypical instance of an actor.
            In a use case model we would have a Customer actor, 
            yet with personas we would instead describe several different types of customers to help bring the idea to life.

            It is quite common to see a page or two of documentation written for each persona. 
            The goal is to bring your users to life by developing personas 
            with real names, personalities, motivations, and often even a photo.
            In other words, a good persona is highly personalized. 
            For example, Figure 1 depicts a persona description for Frances Miller
            . Notice how it includes a photo which helps to make the persona more real.

            ersonas are incredibly useful when you don't have easy access to real users because they act as "user stand-ins",
            helping to guide your decisions about functionality and design.
                Questions like "How would Ross use this feature" or "Would Frances even be interested in this?"
                can start great conversations within your team, getting you to think the way that your users actually would.
                Personas are often used when building publicly accessed web-based software,
                such as the Amazon or eBay systems, as well as shrink-wrapped software. 
                In fact, personas and usage scenarios are very popular at Microsoft and are one of the artifacts described in their Agile MSF process.
                In short, personas are one of a range of modeling techniques which you want to have in your intellectual toolkit.

        :Process of creating
            In The Inmates Are Running the Asylum, Alan Cooper suggests the following techniques for writing effective personas:

                You don't "make up" personas, but instead discover them as a byproduct of your requirements investigation process.
                Write specific personas: you will have a much greater degree of success designing for a single person. The "generic user" will bend and stretch to meet the moment, but your true goal should be to develop software which bends and stretches. Your personas should "wiggle" under the pressure of development.
                You want to know what the persona's goals are so that you can see what your system needs to do, and not do.
                Sometimes you want to identify negative personas, people that you are not designing for.
                A primary persona is someone who must be satisfied but who cannot be satisfied by a user interface that is designed for another persona.
                If you identify more than three primary personas your scope is likely too large.
                You want a finite number of personas, your goal is to narrow down the people that you are designing the system for.
