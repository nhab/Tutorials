            How to do the multiple choice questions
            {
                1 Read the instructions carefully and check how many letters you
                Need to circle.
                2 Skim the questions and the answer choices quickly before the
                recording starts and during the 30 seconds given.  As you do this, 
                3. underline the key words  the words that give you the most
                information, such as the wh- words and nouns.
                4. try to work out what you are going to hear from the vocabulary
                of the questions and/or pictures.
                5. translate any pictures into words and look for details that are
                different in the options.
                6. decide what kind of information you need to listen out for.
                7. Listen to the introduction given carefully.
                8. Answer the questions as you listen.  Circle the letters.  The
                information will be given in the same order as the questions, although
                it might be expressed differently.  Be prepared not to hear the first or
                    even second answer choices mentioned.
                * Remember to make notes beside the question if you are not sure of
                the answer, so you can go back later.
                * Dont leave any questions unanswered.

                ?to listen for people correcting themselves when speaking.  They may
                discuss one of the answer choices and then reject it.

    general tips{
        during exam{
            Before listening			{
                 Make sure you use the 30 seconds given at the beginning of each
                section to read the questions before listening.
                 Make sure you look at all the questions in each section.[maybe 3 second for each , in the given 30 seconds!]
                 Make sure you read the instructions carefully.
                 Make sure you know what form your answer should take e.g. a word,
                a letter, a tick, a phrase, a circle around the correct letter etc
                 Make sure you use the time given to analyse the questions.
                 Decide what you are listening for.  Are you listening for specific
                information, for the main idea or for the speakers attitude?
                 Use the outline given of the topic, who is talking and the situation to
                predict possible answers.
                 When you look at the questions, think about synonyms. You may
                not hear the exact words that are in the answer choices.
            }
            While listening{
                 Listen carefully to the instructions.
                 Listen out for key words and common signpost words like  on the
                other hand, in contrast etc
                 Remember the questions usually follow the same sequence as the
                conversation or talk but the information may be expressed
                differently from the questions.
                 Write down something even if you havent got the answer before
                moving on to the next question.
                 Make sure you continue to listen while you are writing as you only
                hear the tape once.
                 Dont get stuck on a question you cant answer. Just move on.
                 Remember there may be sections of irrelevant information.  Just
                keep listening for the information you need.
                 Write notes in the question booklet as you listen.  This may help you
                go back to a difficult question later.
            }
            After listening{
                 Make sure you transfer your answers correctly.
                 Make sure you use the time given to check your answers.
                 If you cant remember an answer, guess.

                     Go back to the first question.  Decide if you are looking for specific
                    information or whether the question requires you to understand the
                    whole text .  Then either scan or skim the text, as appropriate, to find
                    the answer.
                    
                     Read the relevant part of the text very carefully.

                How to{
                     Read the instructions carefully.
                     Make sure you know how many classifications there are and what
                    letters you have to use.  (E.g. US, J, G & UK in the exercise above.)
                     Read the classifications carefully and make sure you dont
                    confuse the letters which represent each one.
                     Read the statements/phrases or words beside the question
                    numbers and underline key words.
                     Start with the first statement and work your way through them
                    one by one, searching the text to find where the information is
                    mentioned.
                     The questions will not necessarily be in the same order as the
                    text and the wording will probably be different in the text so look out
                    for synonyms and parallel expressions.
                     When youve located the reference in the text, read it carefully
                    and select your answer.
                     Dont leave any statements without a letter.

                    up.
                     Read the first paragraph or section and try to sum up, in your own
                    words, what it is about.
                     Then search through the bank of headings for the best answer.
                     Make sure the heading you have chosen sums up the entire
                    paragraph and not just one idea within it.
                     If you have to sum up the entire text. Read the whole text before
                    looking at the bank of headings.  Try to think of your own heading and
                    then look at the options.

                     Quickly read the statements to get an idea of what the text is about.
                     Take the statements one by one.  Underline the key words.
                     Next search the text to find where the information is mentioned.
                     Remember to look for synonyms and parallel expressions because
                    it is likely that the statements express the ideas differently to the way
                    they are expressed in the text.
